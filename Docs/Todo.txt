	Warhead system :
		Make a warhead factory, works like this :
			Raw Tiberium gives the warhead a bigger explosion radius and adds a small Tib radiation field
			Refined Tiberium (Has to be at least 5%) makes the hull, more means more damage resistant
			Tiberium Chemicals creates a chemical potionous cloud that does DOT
			Liquid Tiberium adds a lot of explosion damage to the warhead and when above 30% it adds a shockwave
			Tiberium Plasma (Either 0% or 50%) creates a melting point in front of the missile that destroys the first entity it comes in contact with and pierces it
